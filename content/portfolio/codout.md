We were contracted to create a mobile application called CODout.

It serves as a tool for finding the best loadouts and gun configurations in the video game "Call of Duty: Warzone 2".

It provides a simple overview of all the guns in the game, along with their best attachments for specific levels. It also shows the fine tuning of the weapons and provides videos on how to use the weapons in the game, as well as specific content about the game.
