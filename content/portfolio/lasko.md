VisitLaško is a smart, mobile guide through the Slovenian municipality of Laško.

We were hired to produce a mobile application and a CMS (Content Management System) to manage the in-app content. The CMS used was Strapi, which provides us with their dashboard, so there was no need for a custom one.
