Projects: Mobile app, Admin panel (dashboard)

YFLab d.o.o. is an IoT company, providing trackers for specific use-cases. Currently, they have a reflective device that helps parents keep track of their younger kids while keeping them safe and visible in traffic, and a bike tracker, that slides into the bike handle.

At the company. we worked on several iterations of the mobile applications required to use their product. Aside from the mobile application, we worked on the admin panel, which was used to oversee day-to-day operations over the device statuses and other information.
