Fundl was a large-scale project, targeted at Generation Z. It intended to bring the younger generation closer to companies and incentivize them to go buy at a certain brand or store, by providing them with discounts that came from partnerships with the brands.

We were a key part of the company, as we were in charge of the entire technological aspect as well as the main idea engine, providing the platform with new and exciting ideas.

Fundl consisted of three software parts: the backend, mobile app, and dashboard. The dashboard was used to create new coupons/discounts, add new stores, and assist users with simple issues.
